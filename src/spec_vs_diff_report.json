  "summary": "All 10 requirements (REQ-42 through REQ-51) appear to be fully implemented. The backend adds beverages category, unit type (per_kg/single), and photoUrl fields. The frontend adds beverages to ProductForm dropdown and Products page sections, unit type selection/display, and photo upload with base64 conversion. Migration logic handles existing products by defaulting unit to single and photoUrl to empty string.",
