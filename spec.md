# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add a back navigation button to relevant pages in the Gujarat Sweet Mart app.

**Planned changes:**
- Add a back button at the top-left of the content area on the Products, Cart, Checkout, Order Confirmation, My Orders, Profile, Payment Failure, and Payment Success pages.
- The back button navigates to the previous page in browser history.
- The button is styled using the existing saffron/marigold/deep-red color palette to match the warm Indian-themed design.
- The back button is not shown on the Home page.

**User-visible outcome:** Users can navigate back to the previous page from all major pages (except Home) using a consistently styled back button at the top-left of the content area.
