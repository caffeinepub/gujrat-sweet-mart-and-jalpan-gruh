  "summary": "The diff implements REQ-1 almost completely. A reusable BackButton component is created and added to Products, Cart, Checkout, Order Confirmation, My Orders, Profile, Payment Failure, and Payment Success pages. The button uses the app's primary color palette via bg-primary/10 text-primary border classes and is placed at the top-left of the content area. It calls window.history.back() for browser history navigation. The Home page is not modified and receives no back button. All 8 required pages are covered.",
